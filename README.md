# Autonomous-Line-Following-Robot-using-ESP32
This project is an autonomous robot that can follow a path using five IR sensors. The ESP32 processes the sensor data at a high speed to determine if the surface is black or white and then controls the motor direction and speed accordingly which designed to take the best route which result in a smooth navigation and proper line following.
